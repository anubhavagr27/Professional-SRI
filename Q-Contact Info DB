[Constraints]



1.The maximum number of records for each test case is less than or equal to50,000. 



2.At the beginning of each test case, the InitDB() function is called. 



3.Each field value given in the input is created with the same format as for thefield that is created in the make_field() function. 



4.In case of the Delete(), Change(), Search() function, there may be severalnumber of records which field value is matched to str parameter.



 



[Example]



Thecode below is exemplary. Thus, may differ from the actual input data.



 

                                                            


Input
 
Result
 

Add(“A”, “111”, “0101”, “a.com”, “aaa”);
 
 
 

Add(“B”, “222”, “0202”, “b.com”, “bbb”);
 
 
 

Add(“C”, “333”, “0303”, “c.com”, “ccc”);
 
 
 

Add(“D”, “444”, “0505”, “d.com”, “ddd”);
 
 
 

Add(“E”, “555”, “0505”, “e.com”, “eee”);
 
 
 

result = Search(NAME, “A”, EMAIL);
 
result.count = 1;

result.str = “a.com”;
 

Change(NAME, “A”, EMAIL, “d.com”);
 
result = 1;
 

result = Search(NAME, “A”, EMAIL);
 
result.count = 1;

result.str = “d.com”;
 

Delete(NUMBER, “777”);
 
result = 0;
 

result = Search(BIRTHDAY, “0505”, MEMO);
 
result.count = 2;

result.str = “”; // result.str value is ignored
 

Delete(EMAIL, “d.com”);
 
result = 2;
 

result = Search(NAME, “A”, EMAIL);
 
result.count = 0;

result.str = “”; // result.str value is ignored
 

Change(BIRTHDAY, “0505”, MEMO, “zzz”);
 
result = 1;
 

result = Search(NAME, “E”, MEMO);
 
result.count = 1;

result.str = “zzz”;
 



 



 



[Input/ Output]



Theinput/output are processed in the Main part code. Thus, a separate input/outputfunction must not be used in the User Code part. 



 



Theoutput result will be given in a format as shown below. (Output value is exemplary.Thus, may differ from the actual output value).
